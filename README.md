## Title: Charity Community Service Management System
In my project, An online platform for booking  home care tools,Medicines,Mobility aids ,personal Health care devices.This website makes it easy and online to access the ongoing Charity HealthCare Communities work at our locations 
## Description

>Many healthcare charity communities are operating in outdated ways, facing significant challenges in efficiently addressing the needs of their users, including derelict adolescents and chronic patients, as well as the general public. Currently, there is a lack of an online platform for seamlessly booking the necessary assistance required by these users.
The existing manual process involves recording user requests, particularly in the case of patients, through traditional methods such as files, records, or books. This manual recording system leads to delays in processing and fulfilling user requirements. Users submit their needs, but the time-consuming nature of the manual recording process results in delayed consideration and fulfillment of these needs.
This prevalent issue is not unique to a single charity community; many are grappling with the inefficiencies of this outdated approach. Recognizing the need for a solution, our project proposes the development of a website that will streamline the process of recording and addressing user needs. This online platform aims to eliminate the delays associated with manual record-keeping, ensuring a more prompt and effective response to the requirements of derelict adolescents, chronic patients, and the wider community.
